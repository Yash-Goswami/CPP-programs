Ghare beta ke pg e betha betha kai kaam thatu nathi , since you are not beign monitored by anyone so you are directly jumping on corn and once you started corn you ended up wasting atleast 2 to 3 hrs on that. and after that ofcourse you will not want to work again as you are into the world of internet and you've soo many things to watch on youtube , to surf on flipkart,amazon,myntra,meesho. you will end up wasting another 2 to 3 hrs and your day is gone. bcoz you will also take nap of for sometime . and all the days at home were like these only means at home we are not working hence take WFH minimum or if you are taking WFH then make sure you are doing it properly and dedicating all your 8 hrs to your work only. after 8 hrs you can do whatever you want. but ofcourse not before that and not in middle of the work. 

Surat is big city and it has big station and ofcourse there are lot's of people who will travel from there as compare to Bharuch. that's why as per the google data, they are saying that big stations has dedicated quota of seats for trains. hence they have separate set of seats as well as separate reservation waiting list quota also as compared to smaller stations like bharuch,vapi,valsad,navsari,nadiyad,anand etc... 
and that's why from surat many seats were showing available but from bharuch there were waiting lists
and also from surat RLWL is showing but from Bharuch PQWL is showing 
means bharuch is included in pool of smaller stations but surat is inculeded in dedicated remote stations waiting lists
and as per google RLWL has higher chances of getting confirmed as compared to PQWL. 
Hence next time whenever you see seats are available from Surat but not from Bharuch but Bharuch has less WL but it's PQWL then never ever book from Bharuch bcoz you are in pool not in dedicated quota of WL hence always book from Surat as you are getting CNF ticket from there immediately. and you can take 50rs general ticket from Bharuch till surat. it's not the big deal but you get the mental peace of having confirmed seat.you don't again and again need to check how much is the PQWL moved , if you book from Bharuch. Ofcourse if seats are available from bharuch then definately you can book it. but don't book in case of WL.check from surat bcoz therea are high chances that you'll get from seats available from there and even if WL then also book from surat bcoz there you'll get RLWL and from surat it also moves faster then compare to PQwL of Bharuch.

In the name of brand Amazon sells all duplicate products. The shoes I bought from flipKart was costly bcoz it's original. and in the name of brand if someone is selling cheap product then definetly it's duplicate and very bad quality product. People are complaining that within 2 days steaching is getting out, pad from below is getting rid off shoes is getting holes within few days it's not the original but the cheap copy of the original shoes they are selling on Amazon hence never order branded stuffs from Amazon if they are selling in cheap rate. FlipKart is still ok and ofcourse most trusted is still Myntra. even Ajio sells cheap products. 

Anand was staying in pg although he was earning 14 LPA , still was living in 7500 per month pg where food is also included 
because of this he was able to make his own house worth 22 lacks he was able to make 2 gold chains worth rs 5 lacks and also
able to gift gold chain ,nose ring and ear ring to his wife and still planning to buy car for him and apart from this 
every 4 month he is going and coming by plane only, and he is properly maintaining his physical health also

he said about physical health from his 5 months of gym experience where he reduced 14 kgs of weight
that never ever eat rice, and even if you want to eat rice then eat very less and that also in day time only
never ever eat rice at night , you can eat subzi and roti but not rice 
rice is responsible for the fat
another thing is vaga pav never ever eat vada pav, it causes lots of fat
in movies when any scene for actors need to shoot where they have to be very fat , at that time to make them fat , usko mota
banane ke liye vada pav khilate hai, vada pav to kabhi bhi mat khao

now it comes to the cheat meal day whenever you've eaten some junk food then at that day  you've do to lots of lots of gym
at that day you need to do double the gym as compare to usual days, actors actresses also eat junk food but when they eat 
at that time they also burn lots of calories by doing double exercise.

now Anand also said to skip one meal in a day and instead eat salads and fruits that's what his instructor at gym said
although he is civil engineer and only does physical work still skipps one meal and eat's only two time in a day and 
for 3rd meal he eats salads and fruits only, so as a computer engineer where I don't need to do any physical work I can easily 
skip one meal and try fruit plate or green salads because here in pg they are not at all provides green vegies so I can try that at aftr noon 

Ananad was doing rigrous gym + physical activity at work still skipping one meal and only eating 2 meals and there also 
never eat rice only eat sabji roti , and that made her body very flexible , he became very active ,his stamina was at next 
level he was able to play cricket for entire day and so many other benefits, all people were using lift to climb at site Anand was using stairs that much stamina he able to got and all his hands legs were become very flexible

agar pet nahi hota to umar kam dikhti hai , that's why everyone is saying I'm big brother , Rahul is yonger brother
