In the name of brand Amazon sells all duplicate products. The shoes I bought from flipKart was costly bcoz it's original. and in the name of brand if someone is selling cheap product then definetly it's duplicate and very bad quality product. People are complaining that within 2 days steaching is getting out, pad from below is getting rid off shoes is getting holes within few days it's not the original but the cheap copy of the original shoes they are selling on Amazon hence never order branded stuffs from Amazon if they are selling in cheap rate. FlipKart is still ok and ofcourse most trusted is still Myntra. even Ajio sells cheap products. 

Anand was staying in pg although he was earning 14 LPA , still was living in 7500 per month pg where food is also included 
because of this he was able to make his own house worth 22 lacks he was able to make 2 gold chains worth rs 5 lacks and also
able to gift gold chain ,nose ring and ear ring to his wife and still planning to buy car for him and apart from this 
every 4 month he is going and coming by plane only, and he is properly maintaining his physical health also

he said about physical health from his 5 months of gym experience where he reduced 14 kgs of weight
that never ever eat rice, and even if you want to eat rice then eat very less and that also in day time only
never ever eat rice at night , you can eat subzi and roti but not rice 
rice is responsible for the fat
another thing is vaga pav never ever eat vada pav, it causes lots of fat
in movies when any scene for actors need to shoot where they have to be very fat , at that time to make them fat , usko mota
banane ke liye vada pav khilate hai, vada pav to kabhi bhi mat khao

now it comes to the cheat meal day whenever you've eaten some junk food then at that day  you've do to lots of lots of gym
at that day you need to do double the gym as compare to usual days, actors actresses also eat junk food but when they eat 
at that time they also burn lots of calories by doing double exercise.

now Anand also said to skip one meal in a day and instead eat salads and fruits that's what his instructor at gym said
although he is civil engineer and only does physical work still skipps one meal and eat's only two time in a day and 
for 3rd meal he eats salads and fruits only, so as a computer engineer where I don't need to do any physical work I can easily 
skip one meal and try fruit plate or green salads because here in pg they are not at all provides green vegies so I can try that at aftr noon 

Ananad was doing rigrous gym + physical activity at work still skipping one meal and only eating 2 meals and there also 
never eat rice only eat sabji roti , and that made her body very flexible , he became very active ,his stamina was at next 
level he was able to play cricket for entire day and so many other benefits, all people were using lift to climb at site Anand was using stairs that much stamina he able to got and all his hands legs were become very flexible

agar pet nahi hota to umar kam dikhti hai , that's why everyone is saying I'm big brother , Rahul is yonger brother
