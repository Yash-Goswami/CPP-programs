by default members of structure are public and inside structures you can have only variables you can't have methods
that's why classes are invented
classes can have variables as well as methods and bydefault all members of class are private hence it's better with respect to security of the data

only static members of class get's initialized to default values in C++, all other non staic variables don't get initialized hence they will always have garbage value
