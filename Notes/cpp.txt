by default members of structure are public and inside structures you can have only variables you can't have methods
that's why classes are invented
classes can have variables as well as methods and bydefault all members of class are private hence it's better with respect to security of the data

only static members of class get's initialized to default values in C++, all other non staic variables don't get initialized hence they will always have garbage value

class Employee{
  static int count;
}

int Employee::count=1111;

so static variable's you need to write at two places inside class also using static keyword you need to write
and outside class also after defining class , you need again declare to write with class name and now no need to write static keyword here
this is how compiler will under stand that this is static variable of class and it will by default ititialize it with 0, if you don't initialize it
static vars can't get initialized inside class you've to initialize it outside class only 

que: how to share data across the objects of single class?
ans: ofcourse by making static variables
because static variables can be accessed by all the objects of class, all object's can read same data using static variable

that's why non static methods can access static variables because It's a class variable hence without using object name directly that variable can be accessed
But
static method can't access non static variables 
it has 2 reasons
1) static members exist even before making object of class hence when you call static method using class name which is accessing non static vars ofcourse it will give error
bcoz no any object exist hence no any non static vars exist at this point of time
2) another reason is , suppose there are three objects of class x ,y,z and now using class name you are calling static method and try to access some variable i
static void fun(){
  i++;
}
now which i is this? is this i belogs to x or y or z? that compiler won't be able to understand that's why this will also give error 
because i exist 3 times bcoz it's not a static 
hence non static function can access static members
but 
static member's can't access non static members
