I've the time for this team, God has given me oportunity to grow my biceps now and get the best physique in the team and have the fat loose, bcoz no one is currently that fit to show biceps in the team , like shashank in framework
don't miss this chance 
That is another reason why I should start exercising now , now is the best time for me . 
Why should I start doing exercise now and that also rigorous and have to have big biceps and good legs and flattened belly(6 pack abs)
1] Advice from Sunil(he is aged now) so , now he has realized that gym/exercise is not something which one should do after facing pain and health issues, everyone should do it now when they are young bcoz when you are young you don't realize what your body is going through , bcoz you've good capability to sustain any pain and slowly slowly health starts to get worsen , slowly slowly different kind of pain starts to get worse and then it's too late to realize that now your situation got worst. 
So, when situation kharab thai jay pacchi karvani vastu nathi exercise, , aa situation kharab no thay ena mate exercise karvani chhe. bcoz when situation is bad at that time you'll have family to feed, you'll have wife and kids , and you still need to continue your work to feed them and along with that you'll need to also buy medicines for you to survive in pain and along with that you'll need to find time for exercising again 

So, vicharvama j aatlo dar lage chhe , to atyar thi j kasrat chalu kari devi joie. 

"If you don't make time for your Wellness, you'll be forced to make time for your illness"

2] you feel good for entire day , your productivity get's increased , you don't feel sleepy for entire day , while working -Whenever I go to Shashank He always looks fresh , never looks sleepy , that's why with full focus he was able to work for the entire day
aapdo addho divas to ungh ma ne ungh ma j jay chhe that's very true and bcoz of that productivity does get's decreased a lot. 
and ungh udadva cha piva jaie toy ungh no ude pan half hour no time waste thai jay
haji ungh no ude etle fs ramva jaie etle bijo 1 to 1.5 hrs waste thai jay
so feeling sleepy (2 hrs waste a day) + tea-cofee(half hour waste a day) + FS(1.5 hrs waste a day) = total 4 hrs waste a day
4 kalak to just fresh feel nathi karta ena lidhe j waste thai jay chhe have vadhya 4 hrs kaam karvana bcoz 1 hr to lunch mate jaay. e 4 hrs ma pan 1 hr to IZN na email kholvama j vaya jay BC edge-browser sav bekar browser chhe 50 vaar passward nakhu tyare 1 vaar khule emay outlook khule pan teams no khule ema ne ema maru dimag kharab thai jaay pachhi kyathi productivity aave , ena mate pachhu mobile kholvo pade bcoz mobile mathi pin nakho 10 vaar tyare to khule 

So, all these things are literally spoiling and minimizing my productivity and major reason is I'm not doing exercise for 1 hr just bcoz of that in my entire Day atleast 5 to 6 hrs are getting wasted, EveryDay I'm thinking that I'm not feeling fresh bcoz I'm not getting good tea but that's not the reason , for feeling sleepiness, major reason is not doing exercise, just start doing exercise , you will also get fit + you will get more productive time as well, in initial 100 days you'll feel very bad pain , but evetually things will start getting good. 
Soln to wasting time in IZN emails and outlooks -> Scheduling event for every friday evening 6 to 7 for reading IZN emails and chats
(now don't ever open outlook and teams if IZN and waste time for opening it thru mobile daily bcoz once you pick the mobile you know that you are gone.)
3] you feel light(you don't feel weight of your body ) 
4] since your productivity get's increased , now you'll get more free time for your other activities , which you can utilize to build your career to advance level 
5] when fat burns , overall heat from the body get reduced which leads to more amount of sperm and more healthier sperm. and amount also get increased because you drink lot's of water also
6] you get relief from all kind of back pains
7] you look good because of big biceps , flattened belly , and good posture which you'll get by exercise only(which will help attracting girls towards you) 
8] you drink lot's of water , you eat healthy food so, ofcourse your sceen starts to glow which will agaian help to attract girls
9] Studies and research have shown that doing exercise reduces stress. ( which will help reducing hair fall)
10] Now mari sathe competition ma lagan mate ghana utari gya chhe medan ma , je mara thi sara pan dekhay chhe and mara karta vadhare saru family background pan chhe (amir chhe gamde jamin pan chhe) and computer engineer pan chhe and salary pan sari chhe and Ahmedabad ma pan chhe , To aa competition ma takva or competition todva mate mari pase ek j vastu vadhi chhe je bija koi na pase nathi, je chhe fitness, big biceps good physique, 6 pack abs is the only option I'm having now only using that I can win the competition of getting the best bride for me. to ena mate to karo bhai atleast
11] Body is thanking me, After I eat good diat, and do Proper exercise, litterally I can feel that body is thanking me.
12]As the fat increases, I'm struggling to even brethe during the sleep and even during when I'm sitting and even when I'm bathing , mu lungs are not properly able grow big inorder to inhale more oxygen , bcoz of which I'm facing brethe shortening issues and I'm getting less oxygen and because of this I'm feeling lot's of stress and heavy ness in my head, just bcoz good amount of oxygen not going inside.So, I have to reduce the fat. 
13]agar pet nahi hota to umar kam dikhti hai , that's why everyone is saying I'm big brother , Rahul is yonger brother 

Etle tame jovo to khara, life na badha j problem na solution ek vastu ma chhe , ke savare 2 kalak body mate time dyo, and exercise karo , 
koi pan problem lyo, life no you name it , and root of the soln to that problem lies in exercising exercising and exercising 
whether it's getting rid of all the pains, looking good, getting more girls, or brightening face sceen, getting more free time for reading books, getting more time for preparing about career,or working with high productivity, or high and healthy spermproduction, or getting hydrated, or reducing fat or winning competition amongs other grooms availalbe in the market or be it fighting hair fall , every problem signle solution , exercise exercise exercise

beginings are always hard but you've to start somewhere
untill you don't start , how can you reach at your destination
Sanjay sir says, if you can't spend 1-2 hrs for your physique, body , to tame jivya j bekaar chho, aa body bhagvaane jevu aapyu chhe evu ne evu ene pachhu aapvanu chhe , kharab kari ne nathi aapvanu 
Aa sharir, body , aa j bhagvaan chhe, jyare aa body j ek dum saras hashe to aapdi andar no bhagvaan aapnne ashirvaad aape ke nai? and pachhi badhu saru saru thava mande k nai?
Ravindrababu said you can change everything in your life, only one thing you can't change for your entire life which is ? -> your body, if you can't change it still you wan't to keep it in bad situation ? 
for entire life you've to live with this body only you can't chage it , so, you've only choice , that's to make this body best for living your soul, so, that your soul thank you 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shashank is the live example of how much a person can alone manage, and can do all the things best. 
1-He has done so much things to maintain his physique, he has the best biceps best body , best fitness in in entire floor. 
2-He has internal employee of siemens , means he has the best skills
3- He has promoted many features, he has developed many features , and in every PI he is giving demo of his solutions 
4- He has the best GF in entire floor, he has that Grl to talk with , means he has good comunication skills
5- along with best contribution for siemens, along with maintaining best physique , along with having best GF , he still managed to prepare best DSA , and now cracked 6 DSA interviews at JP morgar that also in banglore, which is product based company, 
and he is not complaining about that he has working at siemens hence he doens't know anything , about js , react, java or c++, no one is complaining about anything 
even jinesh has switched the company, and ofcourse who ever left siemens are in even bigger product based company, here Shashank must have 25 LPA , hence now he must have 30 to 40 LPA of package now in hand

So, it's not that you can't manage to do the stuff, everything is possible , it's depends on you how you want to spend your time , whether in porn or managing(work+gf+DSA+gym) that also in best possible ways.
so, find out where your time is going 

If aapda thi aa badhu manage nathi thatu , that means aapdo aproach j khoto chhe, 
Sanjay sir e kidhu tu, k tu kasrat kar chopdio vanch  , hu tane badhu j aapish, 
To aapde biju badhu karie chhie kasrat and chopdio j nathi vanchta , ke jema badhi j vastu nu soln chhe,

ofcourse, to aapde focus j atyar sudhi khoti vastu upar karta hata. , exercise karo etle baaki badhi vastu aapo aap solve thava mandshe.

Ghare betha ke pg e betha betha kai kaam thatu nathi , since you are not being monitored by anyone so you are directly jumping on corn and once you started corn you ended up wasting atleast 2 to 3 hrs on that. and after that ofcourse you will not want to work again as you are into the world of internet and you've soo many things to watch on youtube , to surf on flipkart,amazon,myntra,meesho,shopsy. you will end up wasting another 2 to 3 hrs and your day is gone. bcoz you will also take nap of for sometime . and all the days at home were like these only means at home we are not working hence take WFH minimum or if you are taking WFH then make sure you are doing it properly and dedicating all your 8 hrs to your work only. after 8 hrs you can do whatever you want. but ofcourse not before that and not in middle of the work. 

--------------------------------------------
Surat is big city and it has big station and ofcourse there are lot's of people who will travel from there as compare to Bharuch. that's why as per the google data, they are saying that big stations has dedicated quota of seats for trains. hence they have separate set of seats as well as separate reservation waiting list quota also as compared to smaller stations like bharuch,vapi,valsad,navsari,nadiyad,anand etc... 
and that's why from surat many seats were showing available but from bharuch there were waiting lists
and also from surat RLWL is showing but from Bharuch PQWL is showing 
means bharuch is included in pool of smaller stations but surat is inculeded in dedicated remote stations waiting lists
and as per google RLWL has higher chances of getting confirmed as compared to PQWL. 
Hence next time whenever you see seats are available from Surat but not from Bharuch but Bharuch has less WL but it's PQWL then never ever book from Bharuch bcoz you are in pool not in dedicated quota of WL hence always book from Surat as you are getting CNF ticket from there immediately. and you can take 50rs general ticket from Bharuch till surat. it's not the big deal but you get the mental peace of having confirmed seat.you don't again and again need to check how much is the PQWL moved , if you book from Bharuch. Ofcourse if seats are available from bharuch then definately you can book it. but don't book in case of WL.check from surat bcoz therea are high chances that you'll get from seats available from there and even if WL then also book from surat bcoz there you'll get RLWL and from surat it also moves faster then compare to PQwL of Bharuch.
---------------------------------------
In the name of brand Amazon sells all duplicate products. The shoes I bought from flipKart was costly bcoz it's original. and in the name of brand if someone is selling cheap product then definetly it's duplicate and very bad quality product. People are complaining that within 2 days steaching is getting out, pad from below is getting rid off shoes is getting holes within few days it's not the original but the cheap copy of the original shoes they are selling on Amazon hence never order branded stuffs from Amazon if they are selling in cheap rate. FlipKart is still ok and ofcourse most trusted is still Myntra. even Ajio sells cheap products.

Anand was staying in pg although he was earning 14 LPA , still was living in 7500 per month pg where food is also included 
because of this he was able to make his own house worth 22 lacks he was able to make 2 gold chains worth rs 5 lacks and also
able to gift gold chain ,nose ring and ear ring to his wife and still planning to buy car for him and apart from this 
every 4 month he is going and coming by plane only, and he is properly maintaining his physical health also

he said about physical health from his 5 months of gym experience where he reduced 14 kgs of weight
that never ever eat rice, and even if you want to eat rice then eat very less and that also in day time only
never ever eat rice at night , you can eat subzi and roti but not rice 
rice is responsible for the fat
another thing is vada pav never ever eat vada pav, it causes lots of fat -> in company in evening after 4 pm if I want to eat anything then either eat menduvada from south or eat dahi bhel from north or brown bread sandwich.
in movies when any scene for actors need to shoot where they have to be very fat , at that time to make them fat , usko mota
banane ke liye vada pav khilate hai, vada pav to kabhi bhi mat khao

now it comes to the cheat meal day whenever you've eaten some junk food then at that day  you've do to lots of lots of gym
at that day you need to do double the gym as compare to usual days, actors actresses also eat junk food but when they eat 
at that time they also burn lots of calories by doing double exercise.

now Anand also said to skip one meal in a day and instead eat salads and fruits that's what his instructor at gym said
although he is civil engineer and only does physical work still skipps one meal and eat's only two time in a day and 
for 3rd meal he eats salads and fruits only, so as a computer engineer where I don't need to do any physical work I can easily 
skip one meal and try fruit plate or green salads because here in pg they are not at all provides green vegies so I can try that at aftr noon 

Ananad was doing rigrous gym + physical activity at work still skipping one meal and only eating 2 meals and there also 
never eat rice only eat sabji roti , and that made his body very flexible , he became very active ,his stamina was at next level 
he was able to play cricket for entire day and so many other benefits, all people were using lift to climb at site Anand was using stairs that much stamina he able to got and all his hands legs were become very flexible

even NITans and who studied in US and work in US , they are also not that inteligent , they just tried every oportunities they could utilize to go to us , they are not at all inteligent , bcoz by sitting here I've cought their regresssion

JOdhpuri set was very very nice , but I'm Krishna that's why it did not suited me but tha's very well prepared, feeting was just amazing
My father has found great shops for me which gave me great professional cloths like blazer, jodhpuri and ethinc garba , which even crorepatis like bunty jigar and Husan mama doesn't have even their cloths were looking cheaper as compare to mine, neither that Bholu has , even his jodhpuri was looking bad in front of mine, they are litterally crorepatis still my cloths were far better.

I helped Avinash fetching git lab mr's code, and he found it very usefull , and his issue was resolved, so, I should have told him , congratulations, instead I told them Thank me later ,  ,bhai vo tumse 100 times bade hai experience me , to, je thank me later valo swag chhe, e girls mathe vaparay, and aapdi sarkha friends hoy eni sathe vapray , aapda thi senior hoy eni respect karay.


Nhi pata -> is obvious , if we haven't done anything like that before then how can we know that in advance? -> so, it's very normal situation 
how to come out of it? -> puchho na jisko aata hai usko , hume to nhi aata to 5 10 logo ko puchho tabhi to pata chalega. 
even senior managers and managers does 15 meetings for grooming still they don't have the clarity what exactly needs to be done. so,it's obvious k nahi aata, it happens with everyone , but what's next that's very important. Don't just sit idle , and go into long sleep, just go to few persons and try to understand the issue more and then get to know the things what others knows but you don't know. People here are to help you , seniors ne dadthi karva nathi bethadya. 

Even debarati and Komal said , we were literally crying during our initial days , when we were submitting our cps. it was that hard for us. 

So, it's never easy for anyone to start , but you have to start somewhere and have to keep moving on . gradually you become expert on it. there's only one short cut to become expert faster at anything is -> read books and do rigorous exercise, and eat good and healthy food. eat less suger(no suger is even better) and eat less oily food(once a week puri is ok, but eat only 4 not more than that)

Even Jinu is copying my hair style and my clothing styles and my shoes styles, and Santosh as well, Ojas as well. 
Mradul started wearing shoes after watching my style of wearing shoes , and he keep noticing my shoes, and as soon as I came wearing new shoes he said , are new shoes, !!! -> means what people do notice you all the time , ,what you wear , your outfit everything people do notice . 
Sounak also noticed that I'm in new shoes, Shubham , harshal  , Shreyas , olo chashma valo pista khato to meeting room ma betho betho , ene pan notice karya , means everyone noticing me. so, wear good cloths. 
Even when I was in framework team, there also Amit, Viral and Jignesh all 3 were following my style of weering cloths and shoes 
Even Sunil never came in shoes , he always comes in champal , shirish was coming in sandles till he noticed my shoes and color and both then came by wearing shoes like me.

everycompany has the limit to pay, Infosys had the limit to pay me , that kitne bhi inteliggent tum kyun na ho, 20% se jyada to hum tumhe nahi de sakte
TCS had their own limit that kitne bhi inteligent tum kyun na ho 30% se 1 rupiya bhi jyada hike tumhe nahi de sakte, unhone bas 30% tak hi mera hike accept kiya , uske aage to mera ek shabd suna bhi nhi and samne se ok ok karke phhone hi kaat diya sali HR ne to. 
Siemens has also their own limit to give you hike. bcoz Jinesh was the most inteligent person here, and ofcourse he must have got huge hike outside , and that siemens can't afford to meet that range so, he is leaving siemens. 
Jinesh is gold medalist of walchand, and the most inteligent in entire BOM not just in configurator still siemens has the limit.

I managed to convince lady scrum master , and lady manager also 
and my best time till now is with Ladymgrs only. so, it's not the thing to be afraid of , it's the thing to coordinate together with.

Bindu said very well - to use the AI , you first need to identify what is your repetitive work? then it will able to do it. 
your repetitive work is split your entire big work into smaller re-usable chunks and then for those smaller work , it will able to do those things, now it will able to write smaller piece of code, it won't be able to do your entire work
but smaller smaller task it will able to do.

Nhi pata is obvious , kaha se pata hoga , sapna thodi aaega ki ye sab kese kaam karta hai, it's okay to not knowing the things -> Sounak said , it's correct , everything is new and project has the code since 1980 so,and it's been developed by soo many inteligents , and it's very obvious that you don't know all the stuffs, kese pata hoga sab kuch , vo to jab karne bethoge tab pata chalega na , so, puchho, ya fir batao ke nahi samaj aaya , faltu k que mat pucchho, sidha bolo k nhi samaj aaya. and it's very obvious and he said muje pata hoga to bata dunga. nhi pata hoga to jisko pata hoga uske paas jana padega, but don't take the burden and don't stress out that you don't know the stuff. even he don't know anything , he just has the learning attitude and never sits idel just keeps grinding the stuffs keep checking the stuffs, what is visible on the screen, he just keep focusing on the things what is visible on the screen just analyze it what exactly they are trying to say and try to connect the dots, try to grind through available resources and if nothing is enough then go to individual and ask the que, bcoz ofcourse we should value individual's time , everyone has their own deliverables. 

But just don't take stress on you, kuch nahi aana is very obvious

Since I used diff diff perfumes, hence I'm smelling good , hence people like comming towards me and touch me also bcoz I feel fresh and good person because of the fresh and good fragrances comming from me , hence people think that I'm good person and hyginic person, ofcourse I'm hygenic but by seeing my face people might not feel it but after having fragrance they now think that I'm very clear person, people don't even hasitate to toch me bcoz I'm smelling good , people while playing fooseball also don't hesitate to touch me bcoz I'm smelling good , even I feel good with good fragrances. So, chalu rakho spray use karvanu.Even S*nam tried to come very close to me just to smell the perfume even more. That sounds good. Even that beauty of Pr*ti*i even she tried to come very close to me just because I'm smelling good and Dashing . See how much Good perfume can make difference. This is the reason Why D*asht* keep on coming closer to me bcoz of good perfume smell. Ofcourse everyone like fresh good smell  So, if you want to attract people than definately good perfume can work as catalyst to it. And if you want to convert these closeness to even more closlyness then next step is good physique. So again and again all the factors are related to good health and good physique only, hence start doing exercise now. 

I don't like to touch Manthan bcoz he smells very bad and which says that he is very untidy person hence I don't even touch him.

So, that's the difference world make if you smells good vs if you smells bad

Don't be greedy. switch job only if you are underpaid, greed has no solution or no limit, if you think you are underpaid and doing lot's of extra work which should be paid very high then only switch the job. But While switching the job keep few things in mind that here in siemens I'm getting lot's of  lot's of freee time, work pressure isn't there and still good payment is there. 
so, in this free time I can utilize their free gym at my own time ( but gym should not make you comfortable,bcoz just in 20k rs you get best out of best gyms in Ahmedabad, so, don't just stay here for gym, but the reason for staying isn't gym , it's the free time which I get or the extra time which I get to spend on my own life, that's called work life balance which I get here is very awesome, when I had less salary I had to do lot's of work , now I have more salary and I have to do less work that's also one should be considering, any ways money will increase with experience and time but here I'll get some free time to read books and do exercise/gym to make my own self better. The only thing is just don't be greedy for money. Money will follow but for that I need to gain laykaat. and how laykaat should be developed , by reading books and doing gym and eating good food and healthy food. 
Whatever Prakash sir is giving just except it because that's also on top of my lies , that one lie will give me that extra increment , but If I see my work then it's clearly I'm feeling that I'm overpaid. so, I'll gain more knowledge, to increase my payment but I'll not say lie to anyone just to get increment. hu vadhare laykaat kelvish but khoto khoti Prakash sir ne bivdavi ne IZN pase thi vadhare khali khali paisa padavani try nahi karu. If I want more salary I'll gain more knowledge. Here at siemens I'm getting piece of mind, and relaxation. 
Although I want to go to Ahmedabad, because it's near to my family and it's less expensive, But Do you get that level of learning?(learning to aaya pan kai nathi) , do you get piece of mind(ha hardik ne joi ne to lage chhe and ola pappa na bhaibandh Parth ne joi ne pan lage chhe, and Darshan giri ne joi ne pan lage chhe and Shubham lachhu bhai no, Vijay makvana aa badha jetla pan example hu jou chhu badha ni salary mara karta pan vadhare chhe, they all are getting more learning there and they all are looking very happy. , even with more salary, and some are getting WFH like vijay makawana and Darshan giri with very high salaries and good learning curve + no extra work. So, just I need to gain knowledge that's it and salary will automatically increase , but just be greedy here at IZN. 

-------------------------------------------------------
I was thinking that going to pg for lunch(salads)  eats lot's of time  vs if I eat here 
But I was wrong actually going to pg is very very benefitial for me , even for my health and even that is the one which is time saver
Bcoz in last 2 years I've noticed that whenever I eat at office (ofcourse even if I eat just sandwich or just 2 roties) still after eating I feel lot's of lot's of sleepy ness and that wastes another 2 hrs of my time because I'm just feeling tires sleepy ness I goes to play fs and that wastes another hr so, like this when I eat at office I don't know kevi rite tarat j raat padi jay che , 
so, eating at office really wastes lot's of time as compare to going to pg and eat salads
ofcourse whatever I eat here is not at all healthy and still costly , so, ofcourse I should go to pg and eat healthy salads which is health as well as cheap. 
and by doing so I don't get sleep bcoz i'm eating less and healthy + I'm doing lot's of movement so, that also keeps me little bit more healthy
and ofcouse I don't feel sleepy ness after eating less heavy thing and doing soo much of movement, 
---------------------------------------------------------

So, going pg and eating salads-> time saving + healthy + less expensive + productive for work(bcoz by eating salads I never feels sleepy which I feel after eating at office) + fat burning(bcoz more calories burnt since I need to walk a lot also for that) 
eating here at office -> lot's of time wasting(bcoz I feel very sleepy after that) + unhealthy + more expensive + less productive for work (bcoz of sleep)

eating salads at afternoon vs eating salad at night?
i know , at night body can't process more calories because your body don't do any movement at night so, eating at night will increase the fat
But for me eating salads at night and having full meal at afternoon won't work 
bcoz after having full meal at afternoon I feel very sleepy and it's very bad for my work so, for me eating salads at afternoon only will work. 
and related to eating at night-> I shouldn't decrease the amount of food I consume bcoz required nutrients might not be suppllied otherwise, so, what can I do? I've already started using more dal and less rice, and I should only eat 3 roties if small and if big then I should eat only 2 big roties
and increase exercise in morning to burn more fat. but for me eating full meal at afternoon and having salads at night won't work

---------------------------------------------------------
on one monday Aditya(Ravas) also said abhi 11 baje scrum hai and kuch hua nhi hai kaam -> that means on friday even he was relaxing his sal must be 25 lpa above and still on friday he is not doing any work and chillling entire day then only it's possible right that nothing is done and scrum me bolne ke liye kuch karna hai isliye monday ko bhi jaldi aa gaya 
So, it's completely normal that everyone is chilling on friday But why I was chilling on friday? -> because of that one girl which came to play fs with us I wasted entire day, I should be limiting my wasting time on FS 
at most half hr should be enough for fs, as we are IT professional just sitting entire day hence it's obvious to have some movemant activity but that should not be our priority. I should know when to stop which thing . 
Even ofcourse Aditya has not done any thing in weekends also related to work that's why he has nothing to update, still he is earning good enough , So weekend maje karne ke liye hi hote hai kaam karne ke liye nhi hote , 
but still doing extra work will make you ready for switch. 

Playing FS never lasts for half hour, it generally wastes my 1.5 hr on an avg daily that's why Aidtya ne khali friday kaam pattu nathi but mare to darroj j evu thay chhe ke hamna scrum chhe and kai thyu nathi , why?
bcoz I daily wastes lot's of my time playing FS  , instead I can complete my work early and then that time I can spend preparing about switching aaj to time chhe switch karvano
So, it's related to Atomic habit, needs to eliminate habit of playing FS and needs to adapt good habit of not playing FS at all ,and instead for moving body I can go to home and for eating salads.which will involve great movemant
ofcourse I'll able to eat healthy and ofcourse as I'll walk down the street two times so it will burn the calories as well and I'll move out of sleeping zone as well 
so, there are much benefits of not playing time wasting FS at all

Dhruv Rathi video: -> no any weight loss suplement are needed, they don't promote any weight loss ulta health pe nuksaan jyada karenge. 
neigther green tee nor green coffee can promote weight loss , Akash was just faking his experience, he was just become thin like me 
mene nakru tension ma ne tension ma fat loose thai gyu tu same ene pan tension ma ne tension ma j fat loose thai gyu tu , jevu ene thoduk thoduk khabar padva mandi etle tarat j tension gyu etle tarat j enu pet pachhu aavi gyu 
so, he was lying about green cofee beens 

only combination of two things can reduce fat
calary deficit + more exercise that's only can help lossing fat ( as per research) 

greenTee is antioxidant , which can improve health a bit but can't reduce fat , as an antioxidants you can drink it.
-------------------------------------------------------------
mistakes due to which muscle growth stops or you don't see good results even after doing gym

No calorie surplus
Not following a full week workout plan
Not drinking enough water
Overtraining
Using pure form (wrong way of exercising)
Lifting too quickly 
Not getting enough carbs
Not getting enough protein
Skipping leg day
Not stretching 
Not sleeping enough 
Not doing compoud exercise
Expecting qucik result

-------------------------------------------------------------------
But here’s the truth:

Even the best developers feel like they don’t know enough.
The difference is—they don’t stop there. They move anyway.


You think:
“I don’t know X, and others probably do. I’m falling behind.”

But the truth is:

Others are also Googling on the job.

They might not know either—but they’re curious, not ashamed.

The best engineers are problem-solvers, not know-it-alls.

Pragati mate main 3 pagathiya kaya
1. Swabhav -> good nature is very important
2. Skill  -> Skill means practical gyan , means implementation of all your konwldege will give you expereince and this experience is skill
3. mahenat -> hard work , Hardwork beats talent if talent doesnt work hard, skill hoy pan kaam no kare to skill nu shu kaam , skill to side ma padi revani

Even if you don't want to eat salads still buy and keep it in freeze as soon as it get's over 
even if you don't need anything still go to market and buy fruits 
Fruits and vegitables are anti oxidents which will help reduce fat bcoz less calories are going in
when your freeze is full of vegies then your mind will force yourself to go and eat salads instead of eating junk food at afternoon bcoz otherwise it will be wasted
So, keep your freeze full
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Don't play a blame game with Anyone , you will not goint to get anything out of it, it's just simple waste of time and energy. Now when you are in this kind of situation then think that now what can be done further to come out of this situation instead of just blaming on each other

Aa badho dimaag ma stress aavyo kyathi?
1. Aapde badha ne aagal aavta joie chhie hence aapnne lage chhe ka aapde bov pachhal rahi gaya?
    The group where you are the smartest is wrong group for you.That's why to learn the best things , to grow faster I only put myself in that environment where everyone is more smarter than me 
    That's why I started following IITians , Googlers, or the people who are earning very well , 
   So , that was my decision to get surround by the people who are more achiever than me , so now by seeing their achievement why am I started to feel stress and depression? 
bcoz now instead of instead of learning from them that what they did differently , now I've started checking their age their profile that they are younger than me , we've started to look at their earnings that they are earning more than me. We are not looking at the actual learning from them but we are looking at their results. and that's why we are feeling depressed. 
Bhai what they did to reach there that's what you should have looked at. , look at their hardwork, look at their consistency, look at their willingness to ownership, look at their risk to change their field if they are not enjoying. look at their friendships. 

Anu sharma said I'm the dumbest ever , but what I did different than others is sticked to the one thing , she sticked to one playlist of 600 problems and completed only that. instead of looking here and there for different different kind of playlists to solve the DSA. so, that's what we should learn from her. stick to only one resource and complete it thoroughly and then only move to another.if you feel that current is not enough. but never ever move to other resource untill you don't complete the first one.complete the first resource throughly not lightly , upar upar se nhi completely thoroughly karo usko.

Words of Savji kaka
are you able to spend 10% of your income in seva?
Tamari income na 10% to seva mate vapro. Mummy/papa ni seva mate monthly 10% vapru chhu hu? -> nathi vaparto  to vapro , etlu j punya malshe jetlu Savji kaka ne male chhe bcoz they are not able to spend 10% of their income because it's very much amount , but if you spend 10% of your income on your family then it's much more punya than even savji kaka and even Ambani. you are doing better seva then ambani.
