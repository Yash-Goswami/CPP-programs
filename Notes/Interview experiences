try catch (forgot to recape)
exception and their types and exception handling
basic software engineering understanding
like even after our platform and customer's platform is same still why they face defects and how you will track and how you will approach them

static type casting and dynamic type casting
how many types of casting are there in c++

design pattern's  factory , abstract , observer

smart pointers

is there any other way to optimize the costliest operation of the vector , when size becomes equal to capacity so , at that time
new array of double the size get's created  and then copies occurs , is there any way to optimize this costly operation
(evu kai hot to pachhi already implement karelu j hot ne bhai, so there was no meaning of that question but interviewer wanted
to know how can I think , whether I can come up with any new approach or not)

class A{};
whether it will give any error?
I said yes it will give error because classes are meant to have data , but this doesn't have any data so it will give error
but I tried in online compiler , it is not giving any error it executes successfully

hack: whenever interviewer ask any syntactical question and I'm not aware of it then first think and still if not able to figure 
out then say that it dependes on compiler to compiler , how compiler is built to handle this situation based on it
some compiler may give error and some compiler may not give error

java has garbage collector but c++ doesn't have garbage collector
how to detect memory leak in your c++ program ,
write a code to detect memory leak in c++
using smart pointer it can be done

chat gpt gave below solution which uses unordered_map and I also gave same ans in interview
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>

// Global map to track allocations and deallocations
std::unordered_map<void*, size_t> memoryMap;

// Overloaded global new operator
void* operator new(size_t size) {
    void* ptr = malloc(size);
    memoryMap[ptr] = size;
    return ptr;
}

// Overloaded global delete operator
void operator delete(void* ptr) noexcept {
    auto it = memoryMap.find(ptr);
    if (it != memoryMap.end()) {
        std::cout << "Deleting " << it->second << " bytes at address " << ptr << std::endl;
        free(ptr);
        memoryMap.erase(it);
    } else {
        // Handle attempting to delete non-allocated memory
        std::cerr << "Attempted to delete non-allocated memory at address " << ptr << std::endl;
    }
}

// Function to simulate memory leaks
void simulateMemoryLeak() {
    int* dynamicInt = new int;
    // Uncomment the next line to simulate not freeing the allocated memory
    // delete dynamicInt;
}

int main() {
    simulateMemoryLeak();

    // Report remaining allocated memory at the end of the program
    for (const auto& entry : memoryMap) {
        std::cerr << "Memory leak: " << entry.second << " bytes at address " << entry.first << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}

then he asked about writing scema for sql which was very very easy but I did not know sql syntax , this happened with me 
second time
in digite infotech , mumbai ma pan mane sql no bov j easy question puchhyo but since I was not aware of sql syntax or forgot
I didn't answered, aaya pan bov j easy question hato but sql table banava kem e j notu aavdtu 
sql and plsql to aavdvu j joie

but overall maja aavi ho interview devama pan , to pachhi backend ma j focus kar ne bhai maja aavti hoy to e j kar ne aakho 
aaya bilkul maja nathi aavti javascript and react ma to pachhi e j karo ne jya maja aave
