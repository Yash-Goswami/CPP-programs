try catch (forgot to recape)
exception and their types and exception handling
basic software engineering understanding
like even after our platform and customer's platform is same still why they face defects and how you will track and how you will approach them

static type casting and dynamic type casting
how many types of casting are there in c++

design pattern's  factory , abstract , observer

smart pointers

is there any other way to optimize the costliest operation of the vector , when size becomes equal to capacity so , at that time
new array of double the size get's created  and then copies occurs , is there any way to optimize this costly operation
(evu kai hot to pachhi already implement karelu j hot ne bhai, so there was no meaning of that question but interviewer wanted
to know how can I think , whether I can come up with any new approach or not)

class A{};
whether it will give any error?
I said yes it will give error because classes are meant to have data , but this doesn't have any data so it will give error
but I tried in online compiler , it is not giving any error it executes successfully

hack: whenever interviewer ask any syntactical question and I'm not aware of it then first think and still if not able to figure 
out then say that it dependes on compiler to compiler , how compiler is built to handle this situation based on it
some compiler may give error and some compiler may not give error

java has garbage collector but c++ doesn't have garbage collector
how to detect memory leak in your c++ program ,
write a code to detect memory leak in c++
using smart pointer it can be done

chat gpt gave below solution which uses unordered_map and I also gave same ans in interview
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>

// Global map to track allocations and deallocations
std::unordered_map<void*, size_t> memoryMap;

// Overloaded global new operator
void* operator new(size_t size) {
    void* ptr = malloc(size);
    memoryMap[ptr] = size;
    return ptr;
}

// Overloaded global delete operator
void operator delete(void* ptr) noexcept {
    auto it = memoryMap.find(ptr);
    if (it != memoryMap.end()) {
        std::cout << "Deleting " << it->second << " bytes at address " << ptr << std::endl;
        free(ptr);
        memoryMap.erase(it);
    } else {
        // Handle attempting to delete non-allocated memory
        std::cerr << "Attempted to delete non-allocated memory at address " << ptr << std::endl;
    }
}

// Function to simulate memory leaks
void simulateMemoryLeak() {
    int* dynamicInt = new int;
    // Uncomment the next line to simulate not freeing the allocated memory
    // delete dynamicInt;
}

int main() {
    simulateMemoryLeak();

    // Report remaining allocated memory at the end of the program
    for (const auto& entry : memoryMap) {
        std::cerr << "Memory leak: " << entry.second << " bytes at address " << entry.first << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}

then he asked about writing scema for sql which was very very easy but I did not know sql syntax , this happened with me 
second time
in digite infotech , mumbai ma pan mane sql no bov j easy question puchhyo but since I was not aware of sql syntax or forgot
I didn't answered, aaya pan bov j easy question hato but sql table banava kem e j notu aavdtu 
sql and plsql to aavdvu j joie

but overall maja aavi ho interview devama pan , to pachhi backend ma j focus kar ne bhai maja aavti hoy to e j kar ne aakho 
aaya bilkul maja nathi aavti javascript and react ma to pachhi e j karo ne jya maja aave 





-------------------------------------
learnings from tcs interview 
1] even for experienced they don't ask any dificult questions,     questions are really easy to answer
2] mistake I did is just I didn't do revision
    please do regular revision , w/o revision you can't crack any interview
oops need revision, reglarly so have a better notes
for stl I've best notes but do revision-> very silly mistake I did is just I didn't know how to use set very silly mistake, when you're goint home just take your notes with you and do revision a lots of revision is required 
revision means regularly you need to check them
very simple que they asked yaar, that just print unique chars , ignoring the case , using containers
so , I use unordered map , as well as I used set but I just feared to use syntax s.find(x)!=s.end() bcoz i didn't do revision.

3]another reason I missed is what is the ascii codes , it's completely fine no one can remember the ascii code you just needed to duplicate the online compiler and just needed to print the ascii code of lower 'a' and upper case 'A' that's it you can do it and get to know what's their ascii codes  and use it in your logic to convert upper case to lower case or vise versa , but I was in fear to even trying it and use it I was scared soo much , and interview was not that dificult but since I was soooooooo scared and nerves I just totaly screwed up the things , I simply did not even tried to understand what she is saying , what even interviewer is saying , so first of all stay calm , leave the nervesness , bcoz of which my mind was not working even for easy easy things, I just need to use the operation that if char is present in set then don't print otherwise print it that's it very very very easy que but I screwed it up just bcoz of nerves ness 

4] why I had too much fear and nervesness? bcoz of last minute prepration, leave any prepration at the day of interview
any prepration which you want to do just complete it one day before the interview don't stress your prepration till last minute . sleep well on the day of interview eat little less and you are good to go .take deep breathe it will help you reliving stress . just because of lot's of fear and stress I was not able to solve very very very very extreamly easy question, she just asked me 
given string "aaAbbcghttjjklj" just use set to print the unique chars ignoring the case and don't do any extra processing and very simple ans is 
int main()
{
    string str="aaAbbcghttjjklj";
    set<char> s;
    for(char &c : str){
      if(c<'a') c+=32;
      if(s.find(c)==s.end())cout<<c;
      s.insert(c);
} 

it will print "abcghtjkl" that's it 

aatlo easy que me solve to kari nakhyo to but she just said don't use any extra processing that's where I confused and I got scared to much that I was not even trying to implement this which I was having thought , I knew how to do it but still I was sooo scared and nerveous to even try it. , and stress comes bcoz I was just reading too much material in less time in last minutes just before the interivew that's the only reason if I don't get selected

5] the learning is tcs asks very easy questions even for the experienced ones , online resourses and R&D about what tcs asks in the interview did help me lot bcoz technical and non technical ques were being asked from what online sites had listed and puzzles also being asked . and just don't do last minutes prepration , and to avoid this kind of situation regular revision is the must , revision ,revision , revision is the only only only thing I'm missing that's the only thing bcoz of which I failed in gate , that's the only thing if I'll keep failing in future . just note down hard stuff and keep revising it daily daily daily daily , daily reviison is the must bcoz of which candidates are even cracking DE show , goldman sachs , google and uber what else do you need.

6] my english become scary , to keep hands on the english conversation and speeking skills, reading books is the only way, reading books and the good novels that's the only way .

7] to get motivated to do all this things faster do the gym
