Object is an entity that has state(attributes) and behaviour.
Anything which exist in real world / physical world is object.

Class is just a blue print which says how my object will look like, class doesn't exist in physical world.

Women is a class bcoz it doesn't exist in real world, 
but neeta , gita , Himani , Jeel are objects , bcoz they do exist in real world.

in C++ Empty classes also give's 1 byte when we create object of them
class Empty{};

int main()
{
    Empty A,B;
    cout<<sizeof A <<" "<<sizeof B; 
    //o/p : 1   1 

    return 0;
}
