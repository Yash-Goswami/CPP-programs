Object is an entity that has state(attributes) and behaviour.
Anything which exist in real world / physical world is object.

Class is just a blue print which says how my object will look like, class doesn't exist in physical world.

Women is a class bcoz it doesn't exist in real world, 
but neeta , gita , Himani , Jeel are objects , bcoz they do exist in real world.
