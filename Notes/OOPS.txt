Object is an entity that has state(attributes) and behaviour.
Anything which exist in real world / physical world is object.

Class is just a blue print which says how my object will look like, class doesn't exist in physical world.

Women is a class bcoz it doesn't exist in real world, 
but neeta , gita , Himani , Jeel are objects , bcoz they do exist in real world.

in C++ Empty classes also give's 1 byte when we create object of them
class Empty{};

int main()
{
    Empty A,B;
    cout<<sizeof A <<" "<<sizeof B; 
    //o/p : 1   1 

    return 0;
}

Even though an empty class seems like it should have zero size, the C++ standard mandates that objects of any class must have a size greater than zero. This is to ensure that each object has a unique address.
The reason for this is due to the uniqueness requirement of object addresses in C++. Even though an empty class has no data members, the compiler ensures that each object of that class has a distinct address. Therefore, it assigns a non-zero size to ensure uniqueness.

If an empty class had a size of 0 bytes, then two different objects of the same class could have the same address, which would be a problem


watch second half of the below video

It's very very very important to watch it bcoz things discussed in this video is nowhere else present and no one has discussed it till now hence It's very important to watch it
