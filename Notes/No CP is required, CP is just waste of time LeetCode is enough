Pulkit who is 6* at code chef  , master at codeforces (master comes above candid master) solved 3000 to 4000 questions still not able to crack google internship also  , but after doing leetcode he was able to crack google full time offer 
and Fraz and techdose also did only leetcode and cracked google also

if after dooing this much cp if someone is not able to crack google internship also and just by doing leetcode if someone is able to crack full time at google then leetcode is more helpful then cp

take you forward vala thi pan google crack noti thai ene kidhu tu , even after doing so much cp he was not able to crack google because topics asked in google and topics we practice in cp are not same topics we used in cp are just waste of time , and after this rejection take you forward started grinding leetcode and after that only he was able to crack google full time 

So, google ma je topics puchhay chhe that's already covered in leetcode no need to do cp at all -> aa vastu hu nathi keto 
aa vastu je loko 4000 questions kari ne betha chhe cp ma e khud ke chhe, that cp is not required for placement at all
