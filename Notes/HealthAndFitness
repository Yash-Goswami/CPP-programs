My Goal is : Fat loss + Muscle building. 
not any single thing. and you can say more muscle building than fat loss. ( because ultimately muscle building requires lot's of exercises which will burn calories and fat loss anyway happen and also muscles keep on burning calories even when not in active state or while sleeping and for entire day , as your muscle mass increases, your entire day's calory burn will increase automatically so, muscle building automatically supports fat loss so, my goal is not only one but both muscle building + fat loss ) 

Doing these things simultaneously is the best and hardest thing any human can ever able to achieve and I'm now achieving this and that's the best transformation of the body 
bcoz what place will get empty due to your fat loss , that place will be acumulated by Muscle mass and hence no loss of skin hence no stretchmarks on skin after the transformation . no loss and making of new skin during transformation .and hell a lot of other benefits. 

Benefits I'm observing so far:-
1] my favourite: Stool doesn't smells bad, it feels smell less, or it has very mild smell. now after the fulsh toilet feels very fresh that even I go out and come back again then now toilet feels fresh and I like to go in again , earlier I was like , oh no if I'll go again in toilet then there will be very bad smell , but now I'm very calm that now it's not smelling anymore. it really feels soo good. 

2] Urination Normalization : Pela to mare divas ma 20 -30 vaar javu padtu e pan without drinking much water , even though I sip small still I had to go for urination hundreds of time. 
now I drink water a lot but I have to go for urination ocasionally only means very few times in a day , and for night It doen't spoils my sleep , for entire night it just accumulates in small portion in urethra that it doesn't urge to go for urinate hence I get best deep sleep over night now. -> sleep quality increased . and through out the day I get to work with more focus as now I don't need to go for urination more frequently which was also breaking my focus. 

2.2] And since now all the water which I drink is used as inter cellular hydration ( earlier when I was fatty and sodium potatium balance was bad it was stored inside cell , now water is not storing inside cell it's being stored inter cell) and due to this now slowly slowly my skin is improving , pela to hu gadho thai gyo hoy ( old age) evi skin thai gai hati , karachli valie 
it was due to bad hydration , water was immediatly lost from body as soon as I drink due to high sodium and low potatium and inner cell water increased which was increasing weight , and it was blocking inter cell hydration , now slowly slowly water keeps on retaining but in inner cell instead now inter cell hence now slowly slowly my hand's and legs skin glow started coming back , and I'm pretty much sure that my face will also start to glow because hydration will improve in face as well and slowly slowly all these pimple and all will go away as good hydration will increase and bad hydration will go away and it will also take away oil which was generating whole day on face and which was causing pimples but now all these will be reversed and my age will also be reversed soon . 

3]ofcourse better fitting in cloths -> feels tight around sholder , biceps chest and feels loose around waist -> like aesthetic look hence now any closth I wear it looks gorgeous  and stunning on me . I means any cloth I buy it suddenly starts to feel that everything suits me good. 

4] I feel good energy throughout the day , earlier I was just feeling sleepy whole day night and was not able to do any work , now I'm able to do hell a lot of work due to feeling soo good and calm and energetic

5] Focus increased on anything -> like I watch youtube video , or read books , or whether I do communication with anyone , I get very good focus and hence able to grasp more information and get more fruitful information out of it. earlier I was just listening without mind , I was somewhere else but my mind was somewhere else. no focus on anything but now I feel like apun hi bhagwaan hai . 

6] I don't feel stress now, earlier even though I've done with all my work still I was continuously in stress and anxity due to may be bad gut and bad food no any physical activity
and have to 100 kaam baki hoy toy jaray stress , dar ke chinta nathi thati , I still stays very calm. ( although my team is also that good that's also factor affecting but workout and better diet plays a huge role in eliminating contiuous anxity disorder which was exist without any reason )

-> I love junk foods , there's one technique to eat it soo much untill I feel satisfied 
technique is "eat the cheat meals only when you get them for free"

so, all these events where you don't need to pay to eat the junk food or the other food you love to eat , but might not be good for fat loss and muscle building. 
Now here Also the magic is , if you want you can eat as much as you can -> but only 1 vaat nu dhyan rakhvanu ke 32 vaar chavine khavanu , baki jetlu khavu hoy etlu kha but bas khub j mast chavine khavanu

We never ever need protiene powder , it's just business tactics to sell the protiene
Your body needs 1.5x of your weight protiene or 2x protiene daily this is only and only business tactics so that you eat more protiene and hence they will able to sell more protiene and generate good business
Dr. Tejas patel already said that that much protiene like 128 gm or 200 grm protiene per day your kindney can never process that much protiene ( And hence we have many example of died due to kidney failures for many body builders and Athletes) , these are just Businesses which has very badly spreaded the information of protiene. like you need high quality of protiene falana protiene , dhikda protiene for growing the muscles , for recovering the muscle break , but the reality is muscles are built using fiber and protiene does require but you don't require ONLY protiene 
while loosing fat or while building musle your skine also requires many changes to expand or to tighten up , for that you need other nutrients also 
your joints requires gluing while doing extreme resistance training for which you require peanut butter , ghee , oil like things to lubricate joints 
your bones require to be more stronger for that you need calcium from milk , banana  etc .
your legament requires more fiber to be stronger , from Roti , rice , fruits etc...
so, your body needs everything not just protiene 
that's why you need high protiene natural foods like roasted chana, sabhi type ki Dal(legumes) , sprouts, Curd, Milk, Oats , Paneer, Tofu , Daliya etc etc,...
these are natural sources of protiene + they give you other things which your body requires for functioning properly entire day and stay healthey to live long life. 
With only protiene you will die early. 
Don't just blindly follow influencers, they get money from Protiene brands for saying that you needs that much protiene and people only run behind the protiene and khali khali tension lidha rakhe ke yaar hu to khali calories j khau chhu mare to protiene requirenment j puri nathi thati, ela bhai jaroor j nathi protiene ni, 
Business man vadhare kamay etle ene aapda magaj ma ghusava ni badhi j prayatno karya chhe, why to waste soo much money on only protiene when you get overall health benefits from complete food

bcoz your body doesn't need protiene for overall strenghth , immnity , or for overall health. 
you need what god has given to us in natural form , bcoz we are made by God and God has taken care of what our bady needs and given us the right kind of food in natural ways. 
so, aa protiene drama bandh karo.

achaar , packed foods , processed foods , fast foods , Sauces(ketchup) and chutneys having Additives and preservatives  are hell sources of sodium 
which retains water in the body and stores the water in cells and make you feel puffier. 
leave all those

Guava has hell a lot of health benefits , never exclude guava from your fruits lists from market. 
It already has lot's of skin benefits which you can see(That's why ola mistry loko bov j gora chhe only because they eat a guava lot) bija koi ena family ma gora nathi only e je khub guava khay chhe etla j gora chhe) 
and It's very very good for heart, it clears blocked artieries if any blockage as it reduces colestrol and stabilize blood suger, it's antioxident hence helps blood flow bettter. 
it has hell a lot of benefits in body + skin 

Chickoo/sapota has not health benefits. You can just eat them ocasionally for the test that's it. body doesn't have any major or visible benefits and it has more disadvantage then benefits. 
like it has lot's of suger which spikes the insuline hence never eat any fruit at night it will store water and sodium in body due to insuline spike 
it has lot's of fiber hence avoid to take it post workout , avoid taking it with oats etc,... 
so, only ocasionally you can eat, and never eat it's skin/peel it's hard in digestion + it creates irritation in intestines. and not have any vitamiene benefits and it has more issues. 
so, ideally never buy chickoo from the market. 

Walking tips for fast reduce fat
Incorporate incline walking: Walking uphill or on a treadmill incline significantly increases calorie burn—a 5% incline boosts calorie burn by over 50%, while 10% more than doubles it. This engages muscles more intensely, improves posture, and builds muscle endurance without joint impact.
Walk after meals: Light walks (10-15 minutes) post-eating improve digestion by stimulating peristalsis, stabilize blood sugar levels, and enhance insulin sensitivity, creating a metabolic environment conducive to fat loss.
Vary your walking pace: Integrating intervals of brisk walking or power walking (e.g., 2 minutes brisk, 3 minutes normal) improves metabolic flexibility and burns more visceral fat by alternating aerobic and anaerobic effort.




add mint ginger leamon in your drinking water to make it tasty, so that you drink more water. and all these ingradiants helps loosing fat also.
also add rosemary for hair growth naturally, 
everything you will find in zepto
YOU'VE TO HAVE CLEAN YOUR BOTTLE EVERYDAY WITH WARM AND SOAPY WATER AND LET IT AIR DRY TO PREVENT BACTERIAL GROWTH 


Pickle made up from vinegar, Tandoori Mayoniese, Bad designed shoes/ uncomfortable shoes, Bad posture while sleeping due to lack of space bcoz bad is small, sitting improperly on office chair
(sitting with leg tilted , which Mechanical Jugau was informating )=> All these things lead to leg pain ,  I just improved lifestyle for these things and my leg pain went away.
Leamon and Avla doesn't causes leg pain-> vinegar is hazardous for calcium I guess, Vinegar is very acidic , don't eat anything having vinegar

caffiene causes mood swings, nervousness , feeling of  tiredness , feeling of not doing any kind of work , and feeling of stressed even though everything around you is going very good still you feel stressed
Your job is good , your family is good everything is just good , you are earning well but still you feels nervousness , it's because of high amount of caffiene in your body , 
I want to just eliminate the entire caffiene from my life , it will be discomfort in my body but after that I'll feel very good , so that's why I have to sustian 3 -4 days untill my body becomes normal
alternate of caffiene for feeling fresh in morning -> Warm leamon water 

Other reasons for constantly feeling streessed nevousness and tired is shortening of breathing , 
the feeling of tiredness even after full sleep is due to uncomplete or shallow breathe, 
This is because of the fat in my body which is not allowing my brethe to complete durin the sleep that's why I'm facing incomplete brethe problem
I just have to reduce fat from my body to get on the full brethe and all my tiredness and anxiety issues will be solved 
currently due to shortened brethe my brain is not getting enough of the oxygen. 


Ye fat koi jadu se nahi aaya. Ye saalo ke consistantly overeating karne se aaya hai. , to abhi fat reduce karna hai to consistantly bhukh se bhi kam khana padega, calory deficit me tabhi to fat reduce hoga
(Consistantly ketla varsh sudhi dar ravivare , samosa,nudles , dhosa, manchurian,panjabi shaak, idli , aluparotha, pani puri, ragdo , pudla, maggi, bhajia, gota , sandwich , breadpakoda, dabeli , vadapau, paubhaji , bhakri bhaji, etc over eating karyu che, gala thi pan upar nu khadu chhe, to have varsho sudhi to atleast below eat karvu padshe , now khavanu to chhoday nai nakar alag alag vitamines and minarlas and nutriants ni kami sharu thai jaay , to karvu shu? to ke 
1]badhu j junk food avoid  kari ne healthy food par switch karo
  (That I"ve already started->since 3 months I've not eaten any maida things, like samosa, kachori, pizza, pau(vada pau, paubhaji,misal pau, dabeli))
  (And gradually started adapting salads like beet, gajar, cucumber, zuccini, amla, lemon, tomato) 
but this needs to be maintained consistantly for the years to get the result , bcoz this body is result of 15 yrs of overeating , now ofcourse for 15 yr we can't do like that then what should we do to get the result quickly? ->check 2nd point)

2] now you are eating good, that will control your fat to increase more, but we don't just want to control, we also wants to reduce the fat, so, to reduce what shall we do? ->ofcourse we need to burn more calories, that's why along with consistant diet , you need consitant gyming , consitant exercises you'll need to do.

Khana kam nhi karna hai , khana utna hi hai but bas healthy khana start karna hai.
Khana kam karoge to bahot sare aur problems aa jaenge that's not desirable.


why shouldn't we do same exercise everyday? 
bcoz when you do an exercise it will break the tissues of that muscle , now it needs time to recover->muscle tissues breaking and rebuilding(recovering) that's what make them bigger eventually
now you are daily just breaking one tissues , by doing same exercise everyday, you are not giving enough time for that muscle to recover, if they are not recovered then how can it will look bigger
you need to give enough time to every muscle to recover 


Alpino Chocolate peanut butter vs Alpino natural unsweetened smooth peanut butter
Although chocolate one tastes soo good ( although not much good than the natural one) but chocolate peanut butter has lot's of additional suger in natural there's no suger at all while in chocolate 3x to 4x more suger present + good fats are missing in chocolate which are present in natural 
Hence go with natural peanut butter always 
+ Chocolate PB has preservative agents also which are not good for health



When confused what to eat in lunch when you are at company -> 
1.To avoid this situation always keep Salads +Sprouts at home so you don't have to eat anything else just go home and have it because it's nutritious + healthy + lesss costly + you won't feel sleepy
2. Now if you don't have those things at home or you have it but you there's raining outside so you can't go home or you don't want to eat salad for the day
  Then in this situation I've analyzed everything just eat chapati bhaji (Either from company or from mithila(w/o oil) that's it from no where else and nothing else )
  I've analyzed everything with the aspects of money, health(no maida,no oil), productivity in work,no need to go far away, won't increase fat , won't leed to colastrol, I've analyzed all the aspects, 
now don't waste time in deciding what to eat , only eat from all these 2-3 choices listed above.
either eat paneer from company or eat chapati bhaji from mithila, nothing else is as healthy as that 
if going to lunch very early around 2:00 you can try paneer chapati from south 
if going around 3 then go to mithila
if going around 4 to 5 then eat south indian in company it self that's the only healthy option available now 
But best to have is sprouts and salads
