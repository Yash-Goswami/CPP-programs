Pickle made up from vinegar, Tandoori Mayoniese, Bad designed shoes/ uncomfortable shoes, Bad posture while sleeping due to lack of space bcoz bad is small, sitting improperly on office chair
(sitting with leg tilted , which Mechanical Jugau was informating )=> All these things lead to leg pain ,  I just improved lifestyle for these things and my leg pain went away.
Leamon and Avla doesn't causes leg pain-> vinegar is hazardous for calcium I guess, Vinegar is very acidic , don't eat anything having vinegar

caffiene causes mood swings, nervousness , feeling of  tiredness , feeling of not doing any kind of work , and feeling of stressed even though everything around you is going very good still you feel stressed
Your job is good , your family is good everything is just good , you are earning well but still you feels nervousness , it's because of high amount of caffiene in your body , 
I want to just eliminate the entire caffiene from my life , it will be discomfort in my body but after that I'll feel very good , so that's why I have to sustian 3 -4 days untill my body becomes normal
alternate of caffiene for feeling fresh in morning -> Warm leamon water 

Other reasons for constantly feeling streessed nevousness and tired is shortening of breathing , 
the feeling of tiredness even after full sleep is due to uncomplete or shallow breathe, 
This is because of the fat in my body which is not allowing my brethe to complete durin the sleep that's why I'm facing incomplete brethe problem
I just have to reduce fat from my body to get on the full brethe and all my tiredness and anxiety issues will be solved 
currently due to shortened brethe my brain is not getting enough of the oxygen. 


Ye fat koi jadu se nahi aaya. Ye saalo ke consistantly overeating karne se aaya hai. , to abhi fat reduce karna hai to consistantly bhukh se bhi kam khana padega, calory deficit me tabhi to fat reduce hoga
(Consistantly ketla varsh sudhi dar ravivare , samosa,nudles , dhosa, manchurian,panjabi shaak, idli , aluparotha, pani puri, ragdo , pudla, maggi, bhajia, gota , sandwich , breadpakoda, dabeli , vadapau, paubhaji , bhakri bhaji, etc over eating karyu che, gala thi pan upar nu khadu chhe, to have varsho sudhi to atleast below eat karvu padshe , now khavanu to chhoday nai nakar alag alag vitamines and minarlas and nutriants ni kami sharu thai jaay , to karvu shu? to ke 
1]badhu j junk food avoid  kari ne healthy food par switch karo
  (That I"ve already started->since 3 months I've not eaten any maida things, like samosa, kachori, pizza, pau(vada pau, paubhaji,misal pau, dabeli))
  (And gradually started adapting salads like beet, gajar, cucumber, zuccini, amla, lemon, tomato) 
but this needs to be maintained consistantly for the years to get the result , bcoz this body is result of 15 yrs of overeating , now ofcourse for 15 yr we can't do like that then what should we do to get the result quickly? ->check 2nd point)

2] now you are eating good, that will control your fat to increase more, but we don't just want to control, we also wants to reduce the fat, so, to reduce what shall we do? ->ofcourse we need to burn more calories, that's why along with consistant diet , you need consitant gyming , consitant exercises you'll need to do.

Khana kam nhi karna hai , khana utna hi hai but bas healthy khana start karna hai.
Khana kam karoge to bahot sare aur problems aa jaenge that's not desirable.


why shouldn't we do same exercise everyday? 
bcoz when you do an exercise it will break the tissues of that muscle , now it needs time to recover->muscle tissues breaking and rebuilding(recovering) that's what make them bigger eventually
now you are daily just breaking one tissues , by doing same exercise everyday, you are not giving enough time for that muscle to recover, if they are not recovered then how can it will look bigger
you need to give enough time to every muscle to recover 


Alpino Chocolate peanut butter vs Alpino natural unsweetened smooth peanut butter
Although chocolate one tastes soo good ( although not much good than the natural one) but chocolate peanut butter has lot's of additional suger in natural there's no suger at all while in chocolate 3x to 4x more suger present + good fats are missing in chocolate which are present in natural 
Hence go with natural peanut butter always 
+ Chocolate PB has preservative agents also which are not good for health



When confused what to eat in lunch when you are at company -> 
1.To avoid this situation always keep Salads +Sprouts at home so you don't have to eat anything else just go home and have it because it's nutritious + healthy + lesss costly + you won't feel sleepy
2. Now if you don't have those things at home or you have it but you there's raining outside so you can't go home or you don't want to eat salad for the day
  Then in this situation I've analyzed everything just eat chapati bhaji (Either from company or from mithila(w/o oil) that's it from no where else and nothing else )
  I've analyzed everything with the aspects of money, health(no maida,no oil), productivity in work,no need to go far away, won't increase fat , won't leed to colastrol, I've analyzed all the aspects, 
now don't waste time in deciding what to eat , only eat from all these 2-3 choices listed above.
either eat paneer from company or eat chapati bhaji from mithila, nothing else is as healthy as that 
if going to lunch very early around 2:00 you can try paneer chapati from south 
if going around 3 then go to mithila
if going around 4 to 5 then eat south indian in company it self that's the only healthy option available now 
But best to have is sprouts and salads
