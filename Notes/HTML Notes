 <!DOCTYPE html> this says you are using html version 5 (HTML 5)

<meta charset="UTF-8"> UTf-8 is the the most popular charset used because it allowes 1 to 4 byte of char (not fixed sized but char can be of 1 byte it can be of 2 byte it can be of 3 byte or 4 byte
while other charset mostly uses fixed size chars so, either it will ended up wasting more memory or it will end up using less memory but UTF-8 will only use how much is required)

for english it uses 1 byte of character bcoz english is widely used language , so english locale processing will be very high 
for emojis and all it's using 4 byte structure bcoz it will be of very rare kind of content hence keeping it last(at 4 bytes) 
jitna chahie utna hi memory use karta hai hence this is the most popular system.
